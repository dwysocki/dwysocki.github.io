Here are some of my notable projects. For everything else, take a look at my projects on
[GitHub](https://github.com/dwysocki/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/dwysocki), and [LIGO's GitLab](https://git.ligo.org/daniel.wysocki/).

# Current

- [PopModels](https://git.ligo.org/daniel.wysocki/bayesian-parametric-population-models)
    - a Python framework for modeling and inferring properties of populations of
      objects, with specific applications (but not limited to) LIGO sources


# Past

- [plotypus](https://astroswego.github.io/plotypus/)
    - a Python library and command line tool for analyzing the light curves of
      variable stars

- [Hidden Markov Music](https://github.com/dwysocki/hidden-markov-music)
    - a machine-learning music composition program, which learns from an input
      song and uses it to compose new music

- [rakushki](https://ironkladd.github.io/rakushki/index.html)
    - a collection of several variants of the classic "connect 3" game, Shariki

- [Leavitt](https://github.com/astroswego/leavitt)
    - a command line utility for fitting Leavitt's law and its variants, for
      determining the distances to variable stars

- [mini-java](https://github.com/dwysocki/mini-java)
    - a working compiler for
      [MiniJava](http://www.cambridge.org/us/features/052182060X/) written in
      [Clojure](http://clojure.org/)

- [Cepheid Visualization](https://github.com/astroswego/cepheid-visualization)
    - a tool which takes actual observations of a Cepheid variable star, and
      creates an animation to visualize the star's brightness over time

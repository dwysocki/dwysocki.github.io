I am currently an undergraduate student at [SUNY Oswego](www.oswego.edu), where I am pursuing a B.S. in Physics, and a B.S. in Computer Science, with a minor in Astronomy. I am currently working on several astronomical research projects, and wish to begin pursuing a PhD after completing my undergrad.

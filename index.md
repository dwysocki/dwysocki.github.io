I am currently an undergraduate student at [SUNY Oswego](http://www.oswego.edu), where I am pursuing a B.S. in Physics and Computer Science, with a minor in Astronomy. I am currently working on several astronomical research projects, as well as a project in AI music composition. My main research interest looking forward is in creating algorithms and software to discover new correlations in massive astronomical datasets, such as Gaia, SDSS, and the LSST. I will be pursuing a PhD in astrophysics at [RIT](https://www.rit.edu/cos/astrophysics/), beginning in the Fall of 2015.

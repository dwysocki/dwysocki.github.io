I am beginning my Ph.D. studies in the [School of Physics & Astronomy's](http://www.rit.edu/~w-physic/) [Astrophysical Sciences & Technology program](https://www.rit.edu/cos/astrophysics/) at the [Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)](https://www.rit.edu/). Throughout my first year, I will be working as a teaching assistant for introductory physics classes. During this time, I will be searching for a research advisor, whom I will work with for the remainder of my Ph.D. While my research topic has not yet been chosen, I have a strong interest in applying data mining and machine learning algorithms to extract patterns and new discoveries from the datasets collected by projects such as [Gaia](http://sci.esa.int/gaia/), [SDSS](http://www.sdss.org/), and the upcoming [LSST](http://www.lsst.org/lsst/). This is a rapidly growing, new area of astronomy, which I believe will become prevalent in the coming decades.

I graduated from [SUNY Oswego](http://www.oswego.edu), where I obtained my B.S. in Physics and Computer Science, with an Astronomy minor. I worked on several astronomical research projects under the advisement of [Shashi Kanbur](http://oswego.edu/~kanbur), involving various aspects of [Cepheid variable stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheid_variable), and am currently continuing a project on the structure of the [Large Magellanic Cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Magellanic_Cloud) as traced by Cepheids. I also worked on an AI research project, under the advisement of [Craig Graci](http://http://www.cs.oswego.edu/~blue/), which utilizes [hidden Markov models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) to represent musical melodies for song analysis and generation ([semester paper](http://dwysocki.github.io/csc466/assets/papers/semester-paper.pdf)).

In the summer of 2015, I interned at NASA's [JPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory), where I was tasked with finding bugs in a software package which simulates the thermodynamics of Saturn and its rings. The accuracy of this simulation will play an important role in the [Cassini Grand Finale](http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/cassinifeatures/feature20140630/).

My name is Daniel Wysocki. I am currently an undergraduate student at
[SUNY Oswego](oswego.edu), where I am pursuing a B.S. in Physics, and a
B.S. in Computer Science, with a minor in Astronomy. I am currently working
on several astronomical research projects, and wish to pursue a Ph.D in
astrophysics or astroinformatics after completing undergrad.

My resume is available
[here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/resume.pdf).

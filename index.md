I am currently an undergraduate student at [SUNY Oswego](http://www.oswego.edu), where I am completing my B.S. in Physics and Computer Science, with a minor in Astronomy. I am currently working on several astronomical research projects, as well as a project in AI music composition.

In the Fall I will begin my PhD studies at [RIT](https://www.rit.edu/cos/astrophysics/) in astrophysics. I hope to pursue research which exploits massive astronomical data sets, such as Gaia or SDSS, which will require the development of data mining algorithms tailored to astronomy.
